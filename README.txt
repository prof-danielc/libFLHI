1.0

This is an alpha implementation of a modern C++ (C++11) library for the Fuzzy Logic Hypercube Interpolator (FLHI and pronounced IPA: /fli:/).


FLHI was created to solve a very specific problem in nonlinear control however its design allows it to be applied to other fields.

After this implementation in C++ is done libFLHI will be adapted for MATLAB and Python.
